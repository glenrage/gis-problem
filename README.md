# IntegralGIS-problem

```
For this coding question I am looking for you to create an implementation that finds the longest prefix to an input string.

For example, if we had these 3 strings:

abc
abcd
abcdde

and this input string:
abcdd

Which of the top 3 is the longest prefix to the string abcdd?

The answer is "abcd", because "abc" is a prefix but it is shorter than abcd,
 and abcdde is not a prefix to abcdd.
```

Because the instructions said implement however you see fit, as a coding assignment to assess skills I felt it was only fitting to build a small App to test and interact with the Algorithm.
